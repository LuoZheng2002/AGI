When there is more than one convention that satisfy a condition,
several solutions are generated.
When a solution behaves differently from what we expect, such solution is eliminated.
In this way, there will be only one left when the solutions are filtered long enough.

However, a complicated method may contain a lot of places
where more than one convention can explain the logic,
so the solution count will grow exponentially if we keep them all

use the first explanation to generate solution (with multiple predictions)
use other explanations to eliminate some predictions
if there's still more than one prediction, ask questions to the developer
the best way is to generate a problem that can make a difference between predictions
another way is to ask about the problem logically but need to translate the question
into human readable language

or if the developer refuses to answer, keep the confusion until one day it can be solved
when calling a method with confusion, a warning should be raised.
